Client Classification Model
This is a machine learning model that classifies clients by categories based on their characteristics. The model was trained using a dataset of client information and their corresponding categories, and it uses a classification algorithm to predict the category of a new client based on their characteristics.

Getting Started
To get started with this model, you'll need to have the following software installed on your machine:

Python 3.6 or higher
Scikit-learn library
Pandas library
Numpy library
You can install these libraries using pip:

Copy code
pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy
Training the Model
To train the model, you'll need to have a dataset of client information and their corresponding categories. The dataset should be in CSV format, with the client characteristics in the columns and the categories in a separate column.

Once you have the dataset, you can train the model using the train_model.py script. You'll need to specify the path to the dataset as a command-line argument:

css
Copy code
python train_model.py --data_path path/to/dataset.csv
The script will split the dataset into training and testing sets, train the model on the training set, and evaluate its performance on the testing set. It will also save the trained model to a file called client_classification_model.pkl.

Using the Model
To use the trained model to classify a new client, you can use the predict_category.py script. You'll need to provide the client characteristics as a list of values:

perl
Copy code
python predict_category.py --values "value1" "value2" "value3" ...
The script will load the trained model from the client_classification_model.pkl file, use it to predict the category of the new client, and print the result to the console.

Results
After training the model, you can evaluate its performance on the testing set using the evaluate_model.py script. This script will load the trained model and the testing set, predict the categories of the clients in the testing set, and calculate the accuracy of the model's predictions.
